Weather App:
   ✔ Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files. @done(21-01-10 18:49)
   ✔ Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions gthat can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information. @done(21-01-10 19:09)
   ✔ Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app @done(21-01-11 09:28)
   ✔ Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it). @done(21-01-11 13:51)
   ☐ Display the information on your webpage!
      ☐ You should be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
   ☐ Add any styling you like!
      ☐ You should change the look of the page based on the data, maybe by changing the color of the background or by adding images that describe the weather.
   ☐ Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
   ☐ Push that baby to github and share your solution below!

   Notes:
      ☐ need to move the api info to an object for a handler and printer
      ☐ maybe unsplash for background image based in search
      ☐ replace temp fix for background with unsplash api
